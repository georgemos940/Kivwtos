# Snort: An Overview and Historical Background

**Snort** is a widely used open-source solution for network security that can function as both a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** and a **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)**. It is primarily **rule-based**, using signatures and policy rules to identify malicious or suspicious patterns in network traffic.

> **Official description:** ‚ÄúSnort is the foremost open-source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to identify matching packets and generate alerts for users.‚Äù

# Historical Background

- **1998 - Initial release.** Snort was created by **Martin Roesch** as a lightweight packet sniffer and intrusion detection tool. Its speed and simplicity quickly attracted users in both academia and industry.  
- **2001‚Äì2005 - Rapid growth.** A rich, community-driven **rule language** and ecosystem of shared signatures turned Snort into one of the first widely adopted open-source IDS platforms.  
- **2013 - Cisco acquisition of Sourcefire.** Roesch‚Äôs company **Sourcefire** (the commercial steward of Snort) was acquired by **Cisco**. Ongoing development and threat-intelligence curation are now led by **Cisco Talos** in collaboration with the open-source community.  
- **2019+ - Snort 3.** A major architectural update introduced a more **modular, performance-oriented** engine with improved rule parsing, scalability, and extensibility.

# How Snort Works (High Level)

1. **Packet capture:** Snort inspects network traffic in real time (libpcap or equivalent).  
2. **Preprocessors:** Optional modules normalize and prepare traffic (e.g., defragmentation, stream reassembly, protocol decoding).  
3. **Detection engine:** Packets/streams are matched against **rules** that describe threats using signatures, protocol/flow context, and payload conditions.  
4. **Actions & logging:** Depending on mode and rule actions, Snort can **alert**, **log**, or **drop/block** traffic (inline IPS).

# Key Capabilities

- **Signature-based detection:** Match known attack patterns (exploits, malware C2, scans).  
- **Protocol analysis & normalization:** Catch evasions and malformed traffic.  
- **Content and PCRE matching:** Deep payload inspection with flexible conditions.  
- **Multiple deployment modes:**  
  - **NIDS (passive):** Monitor and alert.  
  - **NIPS (inline):** Prevent by dropping packets.  
- **Integration-friendly output:** Unified2/JSON logs; works with SIEMs, dashboards, and SOC tooling.  
- **Rich rule ecosystem:** Community and Talos rulesets, with continuous updates.

# Common Use Cases

- **Intrusion detection & prevention** for enterprise and service-provider networks.  
- **Threat hunting & forensics** via detailed logs and packet captures.  
- **Compliance & monitoring** (e.g., detecting policy violations or suspicious lateral movement).  
- **Lab/training** environments to study network attacks and defenses.

# IDS vs IPS Overview (Before Snort)

Before diving into **Snort** and traffic analysis, it's essential to understand what an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** and an **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** are. Both can be configured within a network infrastructure, but they serve different purposes.

---

# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

IDS is a **passive monitoring solution** designed to **detect malicious activities, abnormal behavior, or policy violations**. It **generates alerts** when suspicious events are detected, but it **does not block or stop traffic**.

### Types of IDS:
- **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):**  
  Monitors traffic across an entire **subnet**. If a signature matches a known threat, an **alert** is triggered.
  
- **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):**  
  Monitors traffic and events on a **single host or device**. Detects local suspicious activity and generates alerts.

---

# Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IPS is an **active protection solution** that not only detects but also **prevents malicious activities**. It can **stop, block, or terminate** the suspicious connection immediately upon detection.

# Types of IPS:
- **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS):**  
  Monitors and protects the entire **subnet** by blocking malicious traffic.

- **Behavior-based IPS (Network Behavior Analysis - NBA):**  
  Detects anomalies by learning what is considered **‚Äúnormal‚Äù traffic** (baselining) and identifying deviations.  
  > *Note: Training is crucial to reduce false positives. A poorly trained system may produce incorrect results or miss attacks.*

- **Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS):**  
  Focused on securing **wireless networks** by detecting and blocking wireless-based attacks.

- **Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS):**  
  Protects a **single endpoint**, actively terminating malicious connections.  
  > *HIPS works like HIDS but adds prevention capabilities instead of only generating alerts.*

# Detection & Prevention Techniques

IDS and IPS solutions typically use **three main approaches**:

| Technique           | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signature-Based** | Matches known attack patterns. Effective for known threats.               |
| **Behavior-Based**  | Detects anomalies compared to normal traffic. Useful for unknown threats. |
| **Policy-Based**    | Compares activities against predefined policies to detect violations.     |

# Summary (IDS vs IPS)

- **IDS** ‚Üí Detects threats, but **requires user action** to block them.  
- **IPS** ‚Üí Detects **and automatically blocks** threats in real time.

# Snort: Overview

**Snort** is an **open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS)** developed by **Martin Roesch** in 1998. It is maintained by the **open-source community** and the **Cisco Talos team**.

> *Official Description:*  
> ‚ÄúSnort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses:  
> - As a packet sniffer like tcpdump  
> - As a packet logger (for network debugging)  
> - As a full-blown Network Intrusion Prevention System.‚Äù
