# How to Activate Windows for Free (My Personal Method)
----------------------------------------------------

This is my current method for activating Windows for free.
Please note:
- This is my personal approach.
- There may be easier or more trustworthy methods.
- I'm sharing this mainly for friends who ask me.

# Step 1 – Visit the Activation Website

Open your browser and go to: [massgrave.dev](https://massgrave.dev/#Method-1---PowerShell)

This site:
- Is well-known in the tech community.
- Automates the activation process.
- Is fully open-source (code is on GitHub).
- Works for both Windows and Microsoft Office.
